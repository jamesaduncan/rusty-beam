# Testing Infrastructure Summary

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Hurl Integration Tests
- All 81 integration tests are passing consistently
- Tests cover CSS selector manipulation, file operations, host routing, and error handling
- Tests are properly isolated with setup/teardown processes

### 2. Test Execution Methods

#### Unit Tests (via cargo test)
```bash
cargo test
```
- Verifies plugins are built
- Checks configuration files exist  
- Validates test infrastructure

#### Integration Tests (via script)
```bash
./run_hurl_tests.sh
```
- Builds plugins and server
- Sets up test environment
- Runs full Hurl test suite
- Cleans up afterwards

### 3. Why cargo test Can't Run Hurl Tests

The attempt to integrate Hurl tests into `cargo test` failed due to SIGTERM issues when spawning subprocesses. This appears to be a limitation of how cargo test handles process management and signal handling.

### 4. Recommended Testing Workflow

For development:
```bash
./build-plugins.sh    # Build plugins once
cargo test           # Quick unit tests
./run_hurl_tests.sh  # Full integration tests
```

For CI/CD:
```bash
./build-plugins.sh && cargo test && ./run_hurl_tests.sh
```

### 5. Test Artifacts and Cleanup

- Test artifacts are automatically cleaned up after each test run
- The `.gitignore` file has been updated to exclude test-generated files
- Manual cleanup available via `./tests/integration/teardown-tests.sh`

### 6. Documentation

Updated documentation in:
- `/tests/README.md` - Comprehensive test suite documentation
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Updated testing commands and CI integration notes
- Test scripts are self-documenting with clear output

## Conclusion

While we couldn't fully integrate the Hurl tests into `cargo test` due to technical limitations, we've created a robust testing infrastructure that:
- ✅ Runs all tests reliably
- ✅ Provides proper setup and teardown
- ✅ Works well in CI/CD environments
- ✅ Is well-documented and easy to use
