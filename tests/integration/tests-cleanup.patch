# Patch to add cleanup DELETE operations to tests
# This ensures tests don't interfere with each other

# After line 123 (first test.html creation), add:
# DELETE http://{{host}}:{{port}}/test.html
# Host: {{test_host}}
# HTTP 200

# After line 665 (localhost test.html creation), add:
# DELETE http://{{host}}:{{port}}/test.html  
# Host: localhost
# HTTP 200

# This would fix the immediate issues, but a better long-term solution
# is to configure separate root directories for different hosts
